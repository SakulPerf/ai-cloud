Note:
Summer 2012, Team of 12 people at Google use 16,000 CPUs to teach AI to recognize cat in VDO.
Winter 2012,  Geoffrey Hinton, Alex Krizhevsky, & Ilya Sutskever use DEEP CNNs on 2 GPUs.

## ML as a Service

* Beaware executives who are going to buy tools solving tasks at the higher levels.
* However, it seems that we’ll see far more companies turning to ML-as-a-service to avoid expensive talent acquisitions and still possess versatile data tools.
* The right move is to articulate what you plan to achieve with machine learning as early as possible.

“I spent last semester building a regression model in Python, and I just did the same thing in 10 minutes with Azure ML”

Note:
This quote came from a graduate student who attended this class at UMass. He had already accepted at offer to go to work for Microsoft post-graduation.
